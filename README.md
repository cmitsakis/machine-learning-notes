# Machine Learning Notes

[Machine Learning Notes](https://github.com/cmitsakis/machine-learning-notes) is a collection of formulas with minimal explanation so it's not suitable for studying, but it's useful as a reference of the most important formulas.
It also includes links to videos that provide more elaborate explanations.

## Table of Contents

- Bayesian Decision Theory
- Parameter Estimation
- Neural Networks

More topics will be added soon.

## Download

Download the PDF file from the latest [release](https://github.com/cmitsakis/machine-learning-notes/releases).

## Build

*XeLaTeX* is required.

You can compile to PDF by running:
```sh
xelatex main.tex
```

## Contributing

Reporting any mistakes you notice (typos, math errors, or inaccurate explanations) by opening issues, is one of the best ways to contribute.

Fixes, improvements, and additions on the covered topics are welcome.

New topics are welcome if they are covered by the books listed in [References](#references).
For other topics, open an issue first.
